Hello, my name is Nehu√©n, currently as of 10/28/2024 I am studying web programming. Eager to continue learning, right now I find myself expanding my 
horizons of knowledge by studying and perfecting my English. I really like to play horror video games, shooters, and immersive story games. I also 
like to move, you could say that I am a fairly active and not very sedentary person, whenever I can I go cycling or go to the gym. Previously I was 
an elite field hockey athlete and I managed to be in the Valencian team and train with the Spanish team. In addition, I studied for a year at a 
high-performance sports center in order to improve in hockey, sadly today due to injuries I stopped practicing this sport.
